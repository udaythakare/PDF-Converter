1. Data Collection:
   - Gather PDF documents containing tables.

2. PDF Parsing:
   - Use PDF parsing library (e.g., pdfplumber) to extract text content from PDFs.
   - Identify and extract tables from the text content.

3. Feature Extraction:
   - Preprocess the extracted table data.
   - Extract relevant features from the table data.

4. Labeling Data:
   - Manually label the extracted table data with desired output.

5. Splitting Data:
   - Split labeled dataset into training and testing sets.

6. Model Training:
   - Train a RandomForest classifier using labeled training data and extracted features.
   - Tune hyperparameters of the classifier.

7. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance on testing dataset.
   - Measure metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

8. Model Deployment:
   - Integrate the trained model into a system for PDF data extraction.
   - Ensure scalability and reliability.

9. Iterative Improvement:
   - Monitor model performance and gather additional labeled data.
   - Experiment with different feature representations and preprocessing techniques.

10. Maintenance:
    - Regularly update and maintain the model.
    - Monitor for performance drift and retrain as needed.
